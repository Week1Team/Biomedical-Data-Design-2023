This algorithm starts with a set of rankings of hospitals provided by doctors, and can perform the following tasks:
<br> Identify whether there are enough jobs.
<br> Determine the solution with minimum costs through Hungarian.
<br> Output ties between doctors and hospitals.
<br> 
<br> Input Requirements
<br> To run this algorithm, the input should be an N x L NumPy array (N â‰¤ L), every row represents the ranking a certain doctor provides for all hospitals (positions). All doctors must give a rate.
<br> 
<br> How to use:
<br> 1. open main file, input the ranking array of doctors and the capacity of each hospital, and see the match result.
<br> 2. open test file, play with the parameters and test.
